# Omniperf

## General
Omniperf is a system performance profiling tool for machine
learning/HPC workloads running on AMD MI GPUs. The tool presently
targets usage on MI100 and MI200 accelerators.

* For more information on available features, installation steps, and
workload profiling and analysis, please refer to the online
[documentation](https://amdresearch.github.io/omniperf).

* Omniperf is an AMD open source research project and is not supported
as part of the ROCm software stack. We welcome contributions and
feedback from the community. Please see the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for additional details on our
contribution process.

* Licensing information can be found in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

## Development 

Omniperf follows a
[main-dev](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
branching model. As a result, our latest stable release is shipped
from the `main` branch, while new features are developed in our
`dev` branch.

Before publishing a new release, we'll open a new `release-*` branch
from `dev` with `*` being the version number of the upcoming
release. This branch will only receive bug fixes and users may
checkout to preview upcoming features.
